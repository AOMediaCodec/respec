    hello world

    Hereâ€™s the dl syntax:

    : key
    :: val
    : key 1
    : key 2
    :: more vals

  : <dfn>Steps to check if a payment can be made</dfn>:
  :: How a payment handler determines whether it, or the user, can
    potentially "make a payment" is also an implementation detail of a
    payment handler. For an example, see the <a data-cite=
    "?payment-method-basic-card#steps-to-check-if-a-payment-can-be-made">can
    make payment</a> algorithm of [[[?payment-method-basic-card]]].
  : <dfn>Steps to respond to a payment request</dfn>:
  :: Steps that return an object or <a>dictionary</a> that a merchant uses
    to process or validate the transaction. The structure of this object
    is specific to each <a>payment method</a>. For an example of such an
    object, see the {{BasicCardResponse}} dictionary of
    [[[?payment-method-basic-card]]].
  : <dfn>Steps for when a user changes payment method</dfn> (optional)
  :: Steps that describe how to handle the user changing payment method
      or monetary instrument (e.g., from a debit card to a credit card)
      that results in a <a>dictionary</a> or {{object}} or null.
